Excellent! The model training completed successfully! 🎉

  Training Results:

  ✅ Model: RandomForest✅ Performance Metrics:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error): $14,381.25
  - R² Score: 0.9825 (98.25% - excellent fit!)

  MLflow Tracking:
  - Experiment created: house_price_model
  - Run logged at:
  http://localhost:5555/#/experiments/2/runs/3df5e95e1d5b411cba8b2b2f2347888c
  - Model registered in MLflow Model Registry as version 1
  - Model transitioned to "Staging" stage

  Artifacts Saved:
  - Trained model: models/trained/house_price_model.pkl
  - MLflow experiment tracking at http://localhost:5555

  Note: There's a deprecation warning about model registry stages - this is
  just a heads-up that MLflow will change this feature in future versions, but
  it works fine for now.

  Next Steps - Deployment Options:

  1. Test the FastAPI service:
    - Build and run the Docker container
    - Test predictions via REST API
  2. Launch Streamlit UI:
    - Deploy the web interface
    - Test predictions through the browser
  3. View MLflow UI:
    - Visit http://localhost:5555 to see experiment tracking and registered
  models

  The feature engineering script executed successfully. Here's what
  was accomplished:

  ✅ Feature Engineering Complete

  Features Created:
  - house_age: Calculated from year_built
  - price_per_sqft: Price normalized by square footage
  - bed_bath_ratio: Bedrooms to bathrooms ratio

  Processing Summary:
  - Input: 77 rows from cleaned data
  - Output: 77 rows with 10 features (original + engineered)
  - Preprocessor fitted and saved to models/trained/preprocessor.pkl
  - Transformed data saved to data/processed/featured_house_data.csv

  Next Steps:
  You can now proceed with model training:

  python3 src/models/train_model.py \
    --config configs/model_config.yaml \
    --data data/processed/featured_house_data.csv \
    --models-dir models \
    --mlflow-tracking-uri http://localhost:5555
