  STREAMLIT APP DOCKER DEPLOYMENT - 2025-11-20
===============================================================================

Summary:
Successfully created, built, and deployed the Streamlit web application Docker container.

What Was Done:

1. Created Dockerfile (streamlit_app/Dockerfile) following the specifications from README:
   - Base image: python:3.9-slim
   - Working directory: /app
   - Copied all files from streamlit_app directory (app.py, requirements.txt, .streamlit config)
   - Installed dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Exposed port 8501
   - Launch command: streamlit run app.py --server.address=0.0.0.0

2. Built Docker Image:
   - Successfully built image: house-price-streamlit
   - All dependencies installed (streamlit, requests, pyarrow, altair, pandas, etc.)
   - Image optimized with --no-cache-dir flag

3. Deployed and Verified:
   - Container running on port 8501
   - Connected to FastAPI service via API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000
   - Streamlit app is accessible and operational

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STREAMLIT APP BUILD & RUN COMMANDS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Build the Streamlit image:
cd streamlit_app
docker build -t house-price-streamlit .

# Run the container (standalone):
docker run -p 8501:8501 house-price-streamlit

# Run with FastAPI connection (recommended - use host.docker.internal for Mac/Windows):
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000 house-price-streamlit

# For Linux, use host network or the host IP:
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e API_URL=http://172.17.0.1:8000 house-price-streamlit

# Access the Streamlit app:
# Open browser: http://localhost:8501

# Verify both containers are running:
docker ps

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ FastAPI Service: Running on http://localhost:8000
✅ Streamlit UI: Running on http://localhost:8501
✅ MLflow Server: Running on http://localhost:5555

Container Details:
- house-price-api: Port 8000 (predictions API)
- house-price-streamlit: Port 8501 (web interface)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
- The Streamlit app connects to the FastAPI service via the API_URL environment variable
- Default API_URL is http://model:8000 (for docker-compose networking)
- For standalone containers on Mac/Windows, use host.docker.internal instead of localhost
- For Linux, use the Docker bridge IP (typically 172.17.0.1) or host network mode

  FASTAPI DOCKER DEPLOYMENT - 2025-11-20
===============================================================================

Summary:
Successfully created and deployed the FastAPI Docker container for house price prediction.

What Was Done:

1. Created Dockerfile (/Dockerfile) following the specifications from the API README:
   - Base image: python:3.11-slim
   - Working directory: /app
   - Installed dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Copied API source files and trained models
   - Exposed port 8000
   - Launch command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

2. Fixed scikit-learn Version Compatibility:
   - Updated requirements.txt to pin scikit-learn==1.6.1 to match the trained models
   - Rebuilt the Docker image with the correct version

3. Successfully Deployed:
   - Container is running on port 8000
   - Health check endpoint working: {"status":"healthy","model_loaded":true}
   - Prediction endpoint working successfully with test data

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Build the Docker image:
docker build -t house-price-api .

# Run the container:
docker run -p 8000:8000 house-price-api

# Test Health Check endpoint:
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected Response:
# {"status":"healthy","model_loaded":true}

# Test Prediction endpoint:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sqft": 1500,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2,
    "location": "suburban",
    "year_built": 2000,
    "condition": "fair"
  }'

# Expected Response:
# {"predicted_price":429840.0,"confidence_interval":[386856.0,472824.0],"features_importance":{},"prediction_time":"2025-11-20T10:47:33.665754"}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API Endpoints Available:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Health Check: GET http://localhost:8000/health
- Prediction: POST http://localhost:8000/predict
- Batch Prediction: POST http://localhost:8000/batch-predict

The Docker container is now running and ready to serve house price predictions!

===============================================================================
  
Created the Dockerfile at the root of your project. Here's what it does:

  Key Features:
  - Base Image: python:3.11-slim as specified
  - Working Directory: /app
  - Dependencies: Installs from requirements.txt
  - API Files: Copies main.py, schemas.py, and inference.py from src/api/
  - Models: Copies both trained model files from models/trained/
  - Port: Exposes port 8000
  - Launch: Uses uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

  The container structure matches the expected layout from the README with all
  files under /app and models in the models/trained/ subdirectory.

  You can build and run it with:
  docker build -t house-price-api .
  docker run -p 8000:8000 house-price-api

Excellent! The model training completed successfully! 🎉

  Training Results:

  ✅ Model: RandomForest✅ Performance Metrics:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error): $14,381.25
  - R² Score: 0.9825 (98.25% - excellent fit!)

  MLflow Tracking:
  - Experiment created: house_price_model
  - Run logged at:
  http://localhost:5555/#/experiments/2/runs/3df5e95e1d5b411cba8b2b2f2347888c
  - Model registered in MLflow Model Registry as version 1
  - Model transitioned to "Staging" stage

  Artifacts Saved:
  - Trained model: models/trained/house_price_model.pkl
  - MLflow experiment tracking at http://localhost:5555

  Note: There's a deprecation warning about model registry stages - this is
  just a heads-up that MLflow will change this feature in future versions, but
  it works fine for now.

  Next Steps - Deployment Options:

  1. Test the FastAPI service:
    - Build and run the Docker container
    - Test predictions via REST API
  2. Launch Streamlit UI:
    - Deploy the web interface
    - Test predictions through the browser
  3. View MLflow UI:
    - Visit http://localhost:5555 to see experiment tracking and registered
  models

  The feature engineering script executed successfully. Here's what
  was accomplished:

  ✅ Feature Engineering Complete

  Features Created:
  - house_age: Calculated from year_built
  - price_per_sqft: Price normalized by square footage
  - bed_bath_ratio: Bedrooms to bathrooms ratio

  Processing Summary:
  - Input: 77 rows from cleaned data
  - Output: 77 rows with 10 features (original + engineered)
  - Preprocessor fitted and saved to models/trained/preprocessor.pkl
  - Transformed data saved to data/processed/featured_house_data.csv

  Next Steps:
  You can now proceed with model training:

  python3 src/models/train_model.py \
    --config configs/model_config.yaml \
    --data data/processed/featured_house_data.csv \
    --models-dir models \
    --mlflow-tracking-uri http://localhost:5555
